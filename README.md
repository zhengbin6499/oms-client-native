# Open WebRTC Toolkit Native SDK

## Introduction
Open WebRTC Toolkit client SDK for native Windows/Linux/iOS applications are built upon the W3C WebRTC standard to accelerate the development of real time communication applications on these platforms. It supports peer to peer and conference mode communication working with Open Media Stream MCU server.

- Supported Windows platform: Windows 7 and above.
- Supported Linux platform: Ubuntu 16.04.
- Supported iOS platform: iOS 9.0 and above.

## Documentation
To generate the API document, go to scripts directory, and run `python build-win.py --docs` for Windows or `./gendoc.sh` in `talk/owt/docs/ios` for iOS.

You need [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) in your path.

## How to build

### Prepare the development environment
Before you start, make sure you have following prerequisites installed/built:

- [WebRTC stack build dependencies](https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/prerequisite-sw/).

### Get the code
- Make sure you clone the source code to `src` dir, that is: that is git clone -b cloudgaming https://github.com/taste1981/oms-client-native src
- Create file named .gclient in the same directory as `src` dir, with below contents:

```
solutions = [ 
  {  
     "managed": False,  
     "name": "src",  
     "url": "https://github.com/open-webrtc-toolkit/owt-client-native.git",  
     "custom_deps": {},  
     "deps_file": "DEPS",  
     "safesync_url": "",  
  },  
]  
target_os = []  
```

### Build
#### Windows
- Run `gclient sync`. It may take a long time to download large amount of data.
- Go to 'src' directory, and run `gn args out/release-x64' for release build. On the prompted config setting, set: 
````
rtc_use_h264 = true
rtc_use_h265 = true
is_component_build = false
use_lld = false
rtc_include_tests = false
woogeen_include_tests = false
rtc_build_examples = false
target_cpu = "x64"
is_debug = false
````
- Run `ninja -C out/release-x64` to finish the build. Output owt.lib will be under out/release-x64/obj/owt/talk/owt.lib; rename it to owt-release.lib for copying to cloud-gaming dependency directories.
- Copy the header files under src/talk/owt/sdk/include/cpp/ to the cloud-gaming include directories.
